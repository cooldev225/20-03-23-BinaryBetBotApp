$80 - Send me compiled executable AND perfom all my tests in my virtual account and

      My Comments: being tested.... need to conclude all pendencies above and what else 
                  is being addressed during tests... 
           a) Martingale is wrong when operating with multiple markets enabled;
           b) Punctuating issue !  in PC of my job and in my brother´s PC the bot is 
              considering 0.35 as 350 and 2.5 as 250. We need to check this regional 
              setting compatibility issue !
           c) Bot is triggering in sequence when Same Digit occourence is ">=" then 
              [Sequence Trigger] value, when it was to be only one trigger when same 
              digit occourence "=" [Sequence Trigger], I called it [insistent mode] 
              and send a proposal to let and and add a control field to check if the 
              bot will trigger as insistent >= or just when =
           d) Proposals in QUEUE is not aligned with the initial strategy of the bot, 
              but I also sent a proposal to add an control field in order to decide if 
              bot will run in queue mode, or ignore simultaneos triggers (randomize and 
         chosse only one) and only trigger if there
         is no buy action in process
